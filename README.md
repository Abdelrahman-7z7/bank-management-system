4. **Administrative Module** - Manages users and accounts.
5. **Account Processing** - Handles user account-related operations.
6. **BankProject (Main File)** - Serves as the entry point of the application.

## Technologies Used

- **Java** (Core language)
- **Object-Oriented Programming** (OOP principles)
- **ArrayList** (Data storage and management)
- **File Handling** (Reading and writing user data)

## How to Run the Project
